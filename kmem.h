** Structures and functions to support dynamic memory
** allocation within the OS.
**
**      The list of free blocks is ordered by address to facilitate
**      combining freed blocks with adjacent blocks that are already
**      free.
**
**      All requests for memory are satisfied with blocks that are
**      an integral number of 4-byte words.  More memory may be
**      provided than was requested if the fragment left over after
**      the allocation would not be large enough to be useable.
