** Functions to perform dynamic memory allocation in the OS.
**      NOTE: these should NOT be called by user processes!
**
**
** This allocator functions as a simple "slab" allocator; it allows
** allocation of either 4096-byte ("page") or 1024-byte ("slice")
** chunks of memory from the free pool.  The free pool is initialized
** using the memory map provided by the BIOS during the boot sequence,
** and contains a series of blocks which are multiples of 4K bytes and
** which are aligned at 4K boundaries; they are held in the free list
** in order by base address.
**
** The "page" allocator allows allocation of one or more 4K blocks
** at a time.  Requests are made for a specific number of 4K pages;
** the allocator locates the first free list entry that contains at
** least the requested amount of space.  If that entry is the exact
** size requested, it is unlinked and returned; otherwise, the entry
** is split into a chunk of the requested size and the remainder.
** The chunk is returned, and the remainder replaces the original
** block in the free list.  On deallocation, the block is inserted
** at the appropriate place in the free list, and physically adjacent
** blocks are coalesced into single, larger blocks.  If a multi-page
** block is allocated, it should be deallocated one page at a time,
** because there is no record of the size of the original allocation -
** all we know is that it is N*4K bytes in length, so it's up to the
** requesting code to figure this out.
**
** The "slice" allocator operates by taking blocks from the "page"
** allocator and splitting them into four 1K slices, which it then
** manages.  Requests are made for slices one at a time.  If the free
** list contains an available slice, it is unlinked and returned;
** otherwise, a page is requested from the page allocator, split into
** slices, and the slices are added to the free list, after which the
** first one is returned.  The slice free list is a simple linked list
** of these 1K blocks; because they are all the same size, no ordering
** is done on the free list, and no coalescing is performed.
