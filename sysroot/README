This directory contains the source code for all user-level processes,
split out by main function.

Naming convention:

    idle()      classic 'idle' process; ensures there is always a
                runnable process to dispatch (vs., for instance, having
                dispatch() pause when there is nothing to dispatch).

    init()      classic 'init' process; starts the other user-level
                processes based on the SPAWN_* macros in users.h

    mainN()     generic main function, used by several user processes
                with different command-line args

    userX()     "one-task" main function; may be started by multiple
                user processes

All of these accept at least one command-line argument.  All are invoked
with command lines of this form:

    name  x  n

Each of these is designed to be #included into the users.c file in the
parent directory.  However, they can be compiled and linked separately
if that is desired (e.g., if VM is being implemented for user address
space separation).

To compile and link these into separate executables, each must be linked
with the two user library objects (ulibc.o and ulibs.o) from the
distribution.
